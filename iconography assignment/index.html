      <h1> Lack of Diversity in Major Hollywood Award Shows Signals Need for Change</h1>

  <h3>Time and time again, Black visual artists in Hollywood are routinely snubbed in their biggest award shows. From the Emmys to the Oscars, Black Hollywood has not been given its due diligence. The numbers below share just a glimpse of this reality. </h3>

		<p> According to Essence Magazine in 2020, in the Academy’s 89-year history, only <u>39 Oscars</u> have been given to Black actors and actresses. This is out of the over 3000 awards that have been given total since its inception in 1929.</p>

		<p> As of 2021, <u>no Black director has won an Oscar</u>, and only 6 have been nominated in the history of the show. Regina King was thought to become number 7 for her role directing <em> One Night In Miami</em> but the film ultimately received nominations in other categories.</p>

		<p>The Los Angeles Times reported in a study back in 2012 that Oscar voters were <u>94 percent Caucasian and 77 percent male</u>. African-Americans made up only 3 percent of the total, Latinos and Asians even less.</p>

		<p>Despite history being made at the Emmys last year, with a record number of 11 Black actors winning awards, <u>no Black actors were awarded in the 12 major categories</u> for the Emmys this year. However, the most notable Black awardee this year was Michaela Coel, for her writing of the show <em> I May Destroy You </em>. She was the first Black woman to win the award for a limited series.

		<p>The Tonys are actually more inclusive compared to their counterparts. Since its start in 1947, awards have been given to more than <u>50 black actors</u>, starting in 1954 with Juanita Hall, recognized just seven years after the show began.</p>

<div class="container">
	 <h3>While there have been some wins here and there, there is still some work to be done. With social media movements like #EmmysSoWhite and #OscarsSoWhite, these award shows have faced a public reckoning for their track record of exclusion. In 2019, a third of the new class of Academy Award voters were Black. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association is working with the NAACP on reimagining Hollywood, and their new class of voters includes 6 Black people in a move to bring reformation to the Golden Globes. We'll have to see if these efforts result in tangible success in the upcoming years. </h3>
